# PS2 Game Info Scraping Scripts

This is a collection of hacky scripts used to modify a collection of CFG files by adding game information for:

* Game Description
* Number Of Players
* Genre
* Release Date
* Developer
* Rating

The scripts take your CFG folder as an argument, and will attempt to add game information scraped using an online service. The enriched CFG files will be saved in a new folder, so the original ones can be preserved.

## Pre-requisites to run the scripts

1. These are bash scripts. You need a UNIX-like environment to run them. They have been tested on a Debian derivative. If you have Windows, they should work with [WSL](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/).

2. Before running the scripts, you need to install [SkyScraper](https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper).

3. It is strongly recommended you create an account on [Screenscraper.fr](https://www.screenscraper.fr). There are different subscription tiers that allow you to use different numbers of threads for scraping. If you feel the service is useful for you, support them through Patreon!

## Disclaimer

**Before trying anything with these scripts, MAKE A BACKUP COPY OF YOUR EXISTING CFG FILES. I AM NOT RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LOSS OF DATA.**

## Using The Scraping Script

### How scrape_info.sh Works

scrape.info.sh takes two arguments:

```
Usage:

./scrape_info.sh <input CFG folder> <output CFG folder>

```

It is STRONGLY advised to use an output folder that's different from your input folder.

For each CFG file in the input folder, the scripts will:

1. Make a copy of the CFG file in the output folder.
2. Extract the game name from the CFG file.
3. Create a fake `GAME_NAME.iso` file (0 bytes) to give to Skyscraper.
4. Skyscraper will contact Screenscaper.fr and try to generate a gamelist file containing only that game.
5. The script will parse the 1-game `gamelist.xml` file to extract information about the game, and save it to the copied CFG file in a format that OPL understands.

As you can see it's all very hacky, but it worked for my needs.

### Using your Screenscraper.fr account

If have an account on Screenscraper.fr, you can add it in the username:password format by editing the CREDENTIALS option in the _Configurable Options_ section of the script.
If you don't create an account, you might be severely limited in how many requests you can perform on their webite. Read the [SkyScraper](https://github.com/muldjord/skyscraper) documentation for more info.

### Using The Local Cache

*After* you complete a scraping pass, Skyscraper will save data in its local cache. If you don't have any new games to scrape, you can disable querying the online service and tap directly form the local cache by setting the `FORCE_CACHE_ONLY` option to `true` inside the script under the _Configurable Options_ section.

### Other Options For The Script

You can configure additinoal options by opening the script and editing values under the _Configurable Options_ section. There are comments that briefly describe what the options do.

## Generating Stats

Use the `create_stats.sh` script, by passing your CFG folder as an argument. This will generate statistics regarding how many CFG files have a certain kind of information.
